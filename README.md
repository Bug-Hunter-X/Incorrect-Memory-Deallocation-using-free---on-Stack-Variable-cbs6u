This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: attempting to deallocate memory allocated on the stack using the `free()` function.  The `free()` function is intended for dynamically allocated memory (using `malloc`, `calloc`, etc.).  Attempting to use it on stack variables leads to undefined behavior and potential crashes. The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle stack-allocated variables.
